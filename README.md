Task Manager

Completely written in python

This program allows users to log in, register new tasks or edit existing ones and add new users.

If the logged in user has admin privileges, they have the capability to register new users, display statics to the terminal and generate text files that provide a breakdown of all the relevant statistics.

The program checks a 'users.txt' file against user input when logging in users, and a 'tasks.txt' file when carrying out any operations relating to tasks. This information is loaded into memory as python dictionary objects.
